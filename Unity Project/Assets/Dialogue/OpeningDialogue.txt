Tory: This is the best camping trip of my life Terry!
Terry: You're telling me!  I'm so exciting to tell Mom and Dad all about it.
Tory: Did you hear that noise?
Terry: Sounded like someone screaming.
Tory: Do you see that?!
Terry: What are those?!
Tory: Those are zombies, Terry.
Terry: Zombies don't exist.
Tory: Well, they do now.
Tory: We need to get to Mom and Dad.  Quickly!
Terry: Yeah, let's go.
