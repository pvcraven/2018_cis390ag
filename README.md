# This Branch
This branch is an attempt to quickly move through the development of the game such that it can be presented by the end of the class. It should be in alpha testing phase by the end of the week, April 13th.

# What this means for the master branch
The master branch will continue to be developed by the class as is has been. This branch is simply here so that there we as students will have something that we can be proud to show our friends and future employers. This is, of couse, predicated on the assumption that given the current rate and quality of development on the master branch that the game will not be completed by the deadline.

# If you feel like this branch is where you want to contribute
This branch is the "move fast and break things" branch. If you see somethign that you want to implement, just do it. There is no bureaucracy here. You dont need to wait to be assigned a card. You dont need to ask permission from anybody. We all want the same thing, and that is to have a crispy, fluid game by the end of class. 

# General Development Flow
I (Nate) am going to be working on this branch full-tilt until friday, so I imagine that this branch will be moving quite quickly, and I will be up in my apartment (Station Square 304). Anybody that wants to join me is absolutly welcome :) I have plenty of Mr. Pibb!

# Current Progress

* Added a "training level" so that people can test out their stuff
* Fluid physics movments (but jumping while not grounded is still a problem)
* Can shoot zombies
* Spawners spawn zombies
* Zombies chase you

# Things this still needs to have the core functionality done

* Make sure that we can only jump when on the floor.
* Die when touched (leter to be replaced with a health system)
* Add a "training level" to show the player the controls
* Add sounds
* Have better background art
* More types of zombies with cooler AI
* Different types of projectiles that do cool things
* Different levels which force the user to adopt different stratagies
